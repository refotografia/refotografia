<h1>Hi!</h1>

<p>I am interested in creating photographs of everyday life and the life cycles of what surrounds me. I conduct research in experimental photography, which includes the reuse of electronic waste (I like dumpster diving) and photographic equipment and materials (refotografia.wordpress.com).</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also looking to collaborate on photography projects.</p>
